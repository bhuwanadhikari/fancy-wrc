We can extract data from facebook by making a bot. The bot could automatically run on the browser as per it is programmed. The bot did the following things to get these data this website has.

At first about 1000 students' username(facebook) is collected from two famous students groups(facebook) of wrc. The 1000 students here may or may not be from wrc. 

To get the girls of wrc following steps were carried out:
    -From those 1000 students, a random photo from their facebook was taken from each of them.
    -Likers of each of those photo was listed. So, in total there were usernames of about one lakh people who were the likers of those 1000 photos.
    -Then, about 20 student were taken manually who are genuinely from WRC.
    -Suppose, if a person likes more than 10 different photos of different people from the pool of that 1000 people, then the person must be a student of WRC.
    - From this, about 2000 persons were collected who were staffs, students of wrc and also the students who already have graduated. 
    - Then, a different bot was made to get the name, username and a photo of those students from WRC.
    - Those photos of 2000 students were fed into the Machine Learning Model that separated the girls and boys with accuracy of 96%. 
    - That threw a list of 200 girls where there were some boys too and also some inaccurate list of other people
    - That was then filtered from a portal where other students from WRC removed the inaccurate data.
